Submarine Game:

Project Overview:
The Submarine Game is a submarine-themed underwater adventure where players pilot a submarine collecting three types of fish; regular, burning, and exploding, each offering different point values toward the 100-point victory goal. The ocean environment features dynamic obstacles that spawn in waves and deplete the submarine's HP upon collision. To survive, players can collect shield items that respawn every 30 seconds, offering temporary protection from damage. In this game, players navigate obstacles while pursuing valuable fish, managing their HP carefully to avoid defeat at zero health points.
